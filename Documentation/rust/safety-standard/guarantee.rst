Guarantees
==========

Functions and ``struct``, ``enum`` and ``union`` types can list guarantees that ``unsafe`` code can
rely upon in the ``# Guarantees`` section. Guarantees are listed in an unordered markdown list.
The wording of guarantees is identical to the wording of requirements.rst. To refer to the return
value of the function, use ``$ret``.
